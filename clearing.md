# Clearing

You head towards the clearing and find a beautiful meadow. There is a path leading further into the meadow and another path that seems to lead back into the forest.

# What do you do?

 [Take the path further into the meadow](meadow_path.md)
 [Take the path back into the forest](forest_path.md)
